## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project involves analyzing a retail sales dataset with the aim of predicting future sales. The dataset includes various **`Features`** related to sales data, including date, country, product, and store identifiers. Each entry represents a unique sale, and the features include date-related attributes (like year, month, day, and day of the week), country, product, and store identifiers.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries

We will be using Python for this project, along with several libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Here are the main libraries we'll be using:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
- **LightGBM**: For implementing the Light Gradient Boosting Machine model.

## ðŸ“š Dataset

The dataset we'll be using includes various features related to retail sales. Each row represents a unique sale and includes attributes such as date, country, product, and store identifiers. The dataset also includes a target variable 'num_sold' representing the number of products sold.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Our main objective is to develop a predictive model that can effectively forecast future sales based on the provided features. By leveraging the power of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, we aim to enhance the model's accuracy and predictive performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow

Here's a brief overview of our workflow for this project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the data and preprocess it for analysis and modeling. This includes converting date columns to datetime format and extracting additional date-related features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distributions of features, and explore potential relationships between the features and sales.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Perform feature engineering to extract additional relevant features or transform existing features to improve the model's performance.

4. **Model Training and Validation**: Train the LightGBM model using a GroupKFold cross-validation strategy and make predictions on the test set.

5. **Sales Disaggregation**: Disaggregate the forecasted total sales into product-level sales using historical sales ratios.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics and assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data using the test set.

7. **Prediction and Deployment**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. If applicable, deploy the model for practical use or further analysis.
